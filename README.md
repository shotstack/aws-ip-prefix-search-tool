# AWS IP Prefix Search Tool

This tool is used to search for AWS IP prefixes by region or service, instead of by IP address.

It is a simple web page with an interface to search the [AWS IP address ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html).
It downloads the [ip-ranges.json](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json) file and makes it searchable.

You can use the tool here: [https://shotstack.io/tools/aws-ip-search-tool/](https://shotstack.io/tools/aws-ip-search-tool/).

The webpage and build script were built almost entirely using ChatGPT in about an hour.
